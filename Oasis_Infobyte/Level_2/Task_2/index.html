            Mahendra Singh Dhoni is more than a cricketer — he is a phenomenon. His incredible calmness under pressure, 
            lightning-fast decisions, and extraordinary finishing skills have made him one of the most respected athletes 
            the world has ever seen. From the dusty lanes of Ranchi to lifting the World Cup at Wankhede, Dhoni’s journey 
            is a modern epic.

            What makes Dhoni unforgettable is not only his achievements but also his character. His grounded nature, unshakeable 
            confidence, and quiet leadership have inspired millions. He showed the world that a leader need not shout to be 
            effective — true leadership flows through actions, not noise.

    <h2 class="heading">Why I Admire MS Dhoni</h2>

    <div class="news-section">
        <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.R31cwNkY55O9EzW2Heqx0QHaHa?w=187&h=187&c=7&r=0&o=7&cb=ucfimg2&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7&rm=3&ucfimg=1" alt="Dhoni" class="float-img">

        <p>
            I adore Dhoni for his rare ability to remain composed in the tenses moments. When the entire world panics, Dhoni analyzes.
            When others break, Dhoni bends but never falls. His leadership style transformed India’s mindset forever — teaching us that 
            patience and clarity can win the biggest battles.
        </p>

        <p>
            Off the field, Dhoni is even more remarkable. No arrogance, no showoff, no fear — only simplicity, discipline, and respect. 
            Even after becoming one of the greatest captains in cricket history, he remained the same humble boy from Ranchi.
